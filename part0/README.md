# Part 0

This is the directory for my submission for Part 0 of the Fullstack Open course

## About

This part of the course covered the basics of web development theory including the browser console, browser vs server, HTTP requests, DOM, and single page apps.

## Exercises

The exercises tested knowledge of the console, HTTP requests, and the responsibilities of the server and browser. Although the project did not require the use of Mermaid to create sequence diagrams, it was recommended and was a useful tool to represent the server vs browser relationship. As such, the submissions are done via Mermaid in Markdown files.

### Exercise 4
Exercise 4 encompassed creating a sequence diagram for the creation of a new note on the following page: https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes. This is the traditional app version.

### Exercise 5
Exercise 5 encompassed creating a sequence diagram for the loading of the following page: https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa. This is the single page app version.

### Exercise 6
Exercise 6 encompassed creating a sequence diagram for the creation of a new note on the following page: https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa

## Side Notes

Exercises 1-3 were documentation readings and did not require file submissions.
I do not own and did not create any of the source material. All credit is to the University of Helsinki and the Fullstack Open team.
The solutions of course are my own.

P.S. This documentation is unnecessary in terms of course requirements and is solely for my bettering my knowledge of documenting repositories via README files. Of course, you may refer to this file and any README's for subsequent parts to help clarify any aspects of that particular submission directory.
