# Part 1

This is the directory for my submission for Part 1 of the Fullstack Open course

## About

This part of the course covered the basics of web development with JavaScript and React including JSX, objects, event-handlers, and rendering components. There were three main applications that were built throughout this lesson, being courseinfo, unicafe, and anecdotes, each with their own subdirectory. I also have a subdirectory named lessonCode which contains the source code of the examples and follow-along code throughout this part.

## Course Info

These exercises revolved around presenting course information through a React web application and a course object as a data input.

### Exercises 1 & 2
Exercises 1 & 2 tested knowledge of JSX, components, and passing in arguments to components. They also touched on nesting components.

### Exercises 3 - 5
Exercises 3 - 5 reformatted the web-app by aggregating the input variables to an object and passing this object into each component. Thus, each component definition required accessing the various object attributes and some attributes' array elements.

## Unicafe

## Anecdotes

## Side Notes

Each subdirectory is its own react application built with ```create-react-app``` and can be run using the following commands: 
```shell 
cd part1/name_of_subdirectory
npm start
```

As stated in [Fullstack Open Part 1](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/introduction_to_react#exercises-1-1-1-2):
> _The application that we will start working on in this exercise will be further developed in a few of the following exercises. In this and other upcoming exercise sets in this course, it is enough to only submit the final state of the application._
As such, all exercises relating to one application in this part of the course will be in the same directory, and the same files.

+ <sub>README's are a very straightforward concept and are not difficult to make. As such, I will not be documenting subsequent parts as well as I documented part 0 in order to save time.</sub>
