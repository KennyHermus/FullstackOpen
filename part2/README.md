# Part 2

This is the directory for my submission for Part 2 of the Fullstack Open course

## About

This part of the course covers modules, rendering collections, forms, interacting with a server, and styling via CSS.

### Exercises 1 - 5
These exercises improved the Course Info application created in Part 1. They focused on refactoring and restructuring components, utilizing the built-in Array reduce function on an array of objects, and modularizing the components.

### Exercises 6 - 10
Created a phonebook that unique names can be added to (alert displayed if name is not unique). Done through forms.

### Exercises 10 - 17
Created a server to hold the phonebook data. Used axios get, put, post, delete to fetch, update, add, and delete information on the server respectively. Also covers basic styling with css as well as error handling.

### Exercises 18 - 20
Work with online APIs to display country data and weather data.

## Side Notes
My .env file with my api key is of course not included in this directory. Make sure to set your api key before attempting to use the countries React app. The countries api can be found at https://restcountries.com and the weather api can be found at https://openweathermap.org.

Each subdirectory is its own react application built with ```create-react-app``` and can be run using the following commands: 
```shell 
cd part1/name_of_subdirectory
npm start
```

As stated in [Fullstack Open Part 1](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/introduction_to_react#exercises-1-1-1-2):
> _The application that we will start working on in this exercise will be further developed in a few of the following exercises. In this and other upcoming exercise sets in this course, it is enough to only submit the final state of the application._
As such, all exercises relating to one application in this part of the course will be in the same directory, and the same files.

<sub>README's are a very straightforward concept and are not difficult to make. As such, I will not be documenting subsequent parts as well as I documented part 0 in order to save time.</sub>
