# Part 2

This is the directory for my submission for Part 2 of the Fullstack Open course

## About

This part of the course covers modules, rendering collections, forms, interacting with a server, and styling via CSS.

## Course Info Con't

This expands upon the Course Info application created in Part 1 by adding functionality that allows for any number of parts or courses, as well as modularity.

### Exercises 1 - 5
These exercises improved the Course Info application created in Part 1. They focused on refactoring and restructuring components, utilizing the built-in Array reduce function on an array of objects, and modularizing the components.

## Side Notes

Each subdirectory is its own react application built with ```create-react-app``` and can be run using the following commands: 
```shell 
cd part1/name_of_subdirectory
npm start
```

As stated in [Fullstack Open Part 1](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/introduction_to_react#exercises-1-1-1-2):
> _The application that we will start working on in this exercise will be further developed in a few of the following exercises. In this and other upcoming exercise sets in this course, it is enough to only submit the final state of the application._
As such, all exercises relating to one application in this part of the course will be in the same directory, and the same files.

<sub>README's are a very straightforward concept and are not difficult to make. As such, I will not be documenting subsequent parts as well as I documented part 0 in order to save time.</sub>
