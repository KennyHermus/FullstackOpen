# Part 3

This is the directory for my submission for Part 3 of the Fullstack Open course

## About

This part of the course covers the backend using Node.js and Express, MongoDB, and more.

## Phonebook Con't

### Exercises 1 - 6
Implementing an Express backend for the phonebook app created in part 2

## Side Notes

Unlike the previous parts, each subdirectory is not its own react application. They can still be run using ```npm start``` but it is better to use ```npm run dev``` as it allows for server updates without having to restart the server each time.

The requests subdirectory is where HTTP requests are stored. These can be tested using the REST client extension in VS Code or via Postman.

As stated in [Fullstack Open Part 1](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/introduction_to_react#exercises-1-1-1-2):
> _The application that we will start working on in this exercise will be further developed in a few of the following exercises. In this and other upcoming exercise sets in this course, it is enough to only submit the final state of the application._
As such, all exercises relating to one application in this part of the course will be in the same directory, and the same files.

<sub>README's are a very straightforward concept and are not difficult to make. As such, I will not be documenting subsequent parts as well as I documented part 0 in order to save time.</sub>
